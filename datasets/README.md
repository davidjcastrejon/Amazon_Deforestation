## Global Forest Change Deforestation Dataset
Forest loss during the period 2000-2022, defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state. Encoded as either 0 (no loss) or else a value in the range 1-20, representing loss detected primarily in the year 2001-2022, respectively with a spatial resolution of 30m x 30m.

## PRODES Brazilian Government Amazon Rainforest Deforestation Dataset
PRODES (Programa de Cálculo do Desflorestamento da Amazônia), or the PRODES deforestation monitoring system, is a Brazilian government initiative that provides annual assessments of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest with a 30m x 30m spatial resolution. PRODES uses satellite imagery to identify and quantify the extent of deforested areas, helping to monitor and combat illegal logging and land-use changes in the region.

## NASA APPEARS Satellite Imagery Dataset
NASA's APPEARS (Agricultural and Water Resources Data from Space) dataset is designed to provide information on agricultural and water resources using satellite data. APPEARS utilizes remote sensing data to monitor various aspects of agriculture, water management, and land use. It includes parameters such as vegetation health, land surface temperature, and precipitation, supporting researchers and policymakers in studying and managing agricultural and water resources.

## Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (Conservation Biology Institute)
This map depicts the 825 terrestrial ecoregions of the globe. Ecoregions are relatively large units of land containing distinct assemblages of natural communities and species, with boundaries that approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to major land-use change. This comprehensive, global map provides a useful framework for conducting biogeographical or macroecological research, for identifying areas of outstanding biodiversity and conservation priority, for assessing the representation and gaps in conservation efforts worldwide, and for communicating the global distribution of natural communities on earth.
